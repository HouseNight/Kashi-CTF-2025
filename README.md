                   *** SNOWy Evening (misc)***

A friend of mine , Aakash has gone missing and the only thing we found is this poem...Weirdly, he had a habit of keeping his name as the password.

*the hint is Snow* 

*and password is Aakash*

```
''''Pity, in place of love,			       	       			  
That pettiest of gifts,      	     	    		      	       	       
Is but a sugar-coating over neglect. 		 	   	  	 
Any passerby can make a gift of it 	  	   	  	   	       
To a street beggar,   	    	       		    	     	  	   
Only to forget the moment the first corner is turned.   	 
I had not hoped for anything more that day.	 	      		   
       	  	   	 	      	  	  	   	       	      
You left during the last watch of night.   		  		 
I had hoped you would say goodbye,     	   	     	 	     	 
Just say ‘Adieu’ before going away,  	 
What you had said another day,
What I shall never hear again.
In their place, just that one word,
Bound by the thin fabric of a little compassion
Would even that have been too much for you to bear?

When I first awoke from sleep
My heart fluttered with fear
Lest the time had been over.
I rushed out of bed.
The distant church clock chimed half past twelve
I sat waiting near the door of my room
Resting my head against it,
Facing the porch through which you would come out.''''

so i use stegsnow to find the hidden text: " stegsnow  -C -p "Aakash" poemm.txt "

"-C" is encode 
"-p" is password 

and i see : pastebin.com/HVQfa14Z

after open see the weird things OOOMoOMoOMoOMoOMoOMoOMoOMoOMMMmoOMMMMMMmoOMMMMOOMOomO.....

so i search for google and know it is The COW programming language

decode it: https://frank-buss.de/cow.html

I made this calculator. I have a feeling that it's not safe :(

we get the script 

```
ef calc(op):
	try : 	
		res = eval(op)
	except :
		return print("Wrong operation")
	return print(f"{op} --> {res}")

def main():
	while True :
		inp = input(">> ")
		calc(inp)

if __name__ == '__main__':
	main()
```

the injection we can exploit is eval()

so we use  "__import__("os").system("cat /flag.txt")"

to get flag:   **KashiCTF{3V4L_41NT_54F3_TKMi5GVr}**

read hex of this file ![pasta](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkkNb9hc1x.jpg)
"BA AB AA AB BB AA BA AB AB BA BA BA AA AB AA BA AA AA AB AA BA AA AA AB AA AA AA AA BA BA AB AB AA BA BA AB AB AB AB BA AA AB AA BB AB AB BA BA BA AB AB AA AA BB AA AA BB A0"

we recognize that is Bacon cipher

**Kings (OSINT) **

Did you know the cosmic weapons like this? I found similar example of such weapons on the net and it was even weirder. This ruler's court artist once drew the most accurate painting of a now extinct bird. Can you tell me the coordinates upto 4 decimal places of the place where this painting is right now.
